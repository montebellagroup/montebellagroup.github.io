                <h3>Northwestern Nevada Water Management</h3>
                <p>For this project the Monte Bella Group is part of a team with advisers to large scale institutional investors. The project includes both a multi-county regional water management strategy based on integrated water resource management concepts (<a href="https://www.planning.org/knowledgebase/watermanagement/">click here for details</a>), as well as a specific infrastructure project that implements components of the strategy and creates an institutional investment opportunity. The infrastructure project is designed to manage stormwater runoff and effluent to mitigate flooding and associated property damage while creating a water resource and amenity for future development of a new Native American community. </p>
